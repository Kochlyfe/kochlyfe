# Joachim Koch

:nerd_face: I'm a Full-stack Software Developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark with a background in economics and statistics. I just want to code every day for the foreseeable future and creating useful things makes me happy. Most experienced in Type- and JavaScript :earth_africa:, but I like Python :snake: just as much.

:herb: Currently working on a web version of a boardgame about climate change for an NGO, using TypeScript, React, Socket.io, Express and Mongo. 

:raising_hand: Get in touch with me if you have an idea for the next project that planet Earth needs but don't deserves.

## Favorite technologies

TypeScript
D3
Socket.io
Scitkit-learn
Tensorflow
